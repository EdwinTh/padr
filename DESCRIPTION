Title: Quickly Get Datetime Data Ready for Analysis
Version: 0.2.1.9000
Author: Edwin Thoen
Maintainer: Edwin Thoen <edwinthoen@gmail.com>
Description: Transforms datetime data into a format ready for analysis.
    It offers two functionalities; aggregating data to a higher level interval
    (thicken) and imputing records where observations were absent (pad). It also
    offers a few functions that assist with filling missing values after padding.
